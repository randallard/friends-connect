The manifest validation tests are passing. Now we need to:

1. Configure connectivity to your Oracle Cloud cluster
2. Push our Docker image to Oracle Cloud Container Registry
3. Deploy our application

Obtain

1. The API endpoint (146.235.212.7:6443 from your earlier message)
2. The cluster credentials/kubeconfig file

If you have these, we can:

1. Back up your existing kubeconfig (if any):
```bash
cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

2. Configure the new kubeconfig. Do you have an OCI CLI config file or a kubeconfig file from the Oracle Cloud console that we can use?

Let me know which credentials you have available and I'll help you set up the connection to your cluster.

We've successfully initiated the setup of your Kubernetes infrastructure on Oracle Cloud Free Tier. Here's what we've accomplished:

1. VCN (Virtual Cloud Network) Creation:
- Oracle automatically created a VCN named `oke-vcn-quick-khetlyr-pool-78805b5ba`
- Set up with 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block
- Includes necessary subnets for Kubernetes

2. Kubernetes Cluster Setup:
- Created a Basic cluster
- Using Kubernetes version v1.31.1
- Set up with Oracle-managed secrets encryption
- Configured for free tier usage
- Credentials valid until 12/27/2029

3. Node Pool Configuration:
- Named `khetlyr-pool`
- Using ARM-based VM.Standard.A1.Flex instances
- 1 OCPU and 6GB memory per node
- 2 managed nodes total

4. Network Access Setup:
- Public API endpoint: 146.235.212.7:6443
- Private API endpoint: 10.0.0.3:6443
- Services CIDR: 10.96.0.0/16
- Load balancer subnets configured

We're ready to deploy the friends-connect application and proceed with preparing for deployment
